Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention `project/internshipGroupX`\r - Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed. The backend code will be integrated with the front-end application which means any mismatch in the expected request body will lead to failure in successful integration.",
